## Monster killer application

- we got the health of a monster and we got the health of a player, we also got a bonus life, in case our health drops to zero we'll be able to recover

- we got four buttons which we can press to attack the monster, to launch a strong attack against the monster, to heal ourselves and also to output some log information about the past rounds.

- we actually ask the player how much health monster and player should have, 100 health points, 50, 1000
